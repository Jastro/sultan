## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome help from anyone who wants to improve or expand the translation!  
Here are some guidelines to keep things consistent and enjoyable:

### 📝 Guidelines

- **Maintain thematic tone**: This game uses a setting inspired by *One Thousand and One Nights*, with formal and poetic language. Try to preserve that tone in your translations.
- **Be consistent**: Follow terminology already used in the project (e.g. always use “tarjeta Sultán” for "Sultan Card").
- **Avoid literal translation** if it breaks immersion. Prioritize natural phrasing over word-for-word accuracy.
- **Use gender-neutral language** where appropriate, unless the original context clearly defines otherwise.
- **Test your translations in-game** before submitting changes, if possible.

# 🇪🇸 Sultan's Game - Spanish Translation Project

Welcome to the **Sultan's Game** Spanish translation repository!

This project aims to improve and finalize the Spanish localization of the game *Sultan's Game* (version **1.0.12695**). The current translation is originally generated using Google Translate and is now being revised **manually** for quality, narrative coherence, and immersion in the setting of *One Thousand and One Nights*.

## 📌 Version Compatibility

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This translation is currently tailored for **version 1.0.12695** of the game.  
If you are using a different version, we recommend:

- ⚠️ **Not overwriting the original files**, as it may cause unexpected issues.  
- ✅ Always **make a backup** of the original files before applying the translation.

---

## 🗂️ Where to Place Translated Files

Put all translated `.json` and language files into the following directory:
```Sultan's Game_Data\StreamingAssets\i18n\en```

The translation replaces the English localization (for now). You can rename the folder later to support multiple languages once the game includes a proper language selector.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We welcome help from anyone willing to improve the Spanish translation!

### ✔️ Guidelines for Contributions

1. **Be consistent** with the existing tone and terminology.
2. Maintain the **narrative flavor of the setting**, inspired by *Arabian Nights* and Middle Eastern courtly intrigue.
3. Translate **naturally**, not literally. Avoid awkward phrases from machine translation.
4. If unsure about context, leave a comment or mark it with `// TODO: Review` in the file.
